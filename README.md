# Summary

On the <a href="https://DigiKala.com">DigiKala</a> site, product buyers could send photos of the product they bought And the photos were placed on the site along with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif">EXIF</a> data, and Digikala did not delete them So we came and wrote a script to collect EXIF (MetaData) photos. This data could contain important information such as address of customer (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotagging">Geotagging</a>)

# PoC
